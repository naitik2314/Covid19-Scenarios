Here you can import custom Case Counts data to display alongside the results of the simulation. Case counts are
displayed as dots on the trajectories plot. This allows to compare the results of the model with real-world statistics.

The uploaded files are expected in CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) format. You can check out
some concrete examples of case counts files in our data directory, for example:
[USA-New York.tsv](https://github.com/neherlab/covid19_scenarios/blob/release/data/case-counts/unitedstates/USA-New%20York.tsv)

After internal conversion, each row will be validated according to this JSON schema:
[CaseCountsDatum.yml](https://github.com/neherlab/covid19_scenarios/blob/release/schemas/CaseCountsDatum.yml).

You can omit the missing values. But don't forget to put the appropriate number of columns (with consecutive tabs or commas).
